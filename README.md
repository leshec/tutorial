I'm following along with this [Astro tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/)

My aims are to have some end products while I learn how to:

[] easily make and deploy a basic static webpage.
[] make an interactive quiz like webapp.
[] have some more front end type experience while I learn the backend.
[] create a set of tools where I can use HTMX
[] i am seperately learning more vanilla approaches.

TODO: 

Make a webpage for my local union.
